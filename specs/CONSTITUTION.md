# DMD Project Constitution

This document outlines our fundamental principles and standards for development.

## 1. Code Quality Standards

### 1.1 Code Organization
- All code must follow consistent file and directory structure
- Modules should be logically organized and follow single responsibility principle
- Maximum file length: 500 lines (excluding tests)
- Functions should be kept under 30 lines where possible

### 1.2 Code Style
- Consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Comments for complex logic and public APIs
- No commented-out code in production
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle must be followed

### 1.3 Error Handling
- All errors must be properly caught and handled
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
- Logging must be implemented for debugging purposes
- Failed operations must leave the system in router consistent state

## 2. Testing Standards

### 2.1 Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage required
- All new features must include tests
- All bug fixes must include regression tests
- Critical paths must have 100% coverage

### 2.2 Test Types
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for critical operations

### 2.3 Test Quality
- Tests must be deterministic
- No test dependencies on external services
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Tests must be maintainable and readable

## 3. User Experience Consistency

### 3.1 Interface Design
- Consistent visual hierarchy across all interfaces
- Uniform color scheme and typography
- Predictable navigation patterns
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Simple and intuative UI

### 3.2 Interaction Patterns
- Consistent error handling and messaging
- Uniform loading states and indicators
- Standard keyboard shortcuts where applicable
- Accessible to screen readers and assistive technologies

### 3.3 Performance Perception
- Immediate feedback for user actions
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Smooth animations and transitions

## 4. Performance Requirements

### 4.1 Response Times
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 500ms
- Animation frame rate: 60fps
- Time to interactive: < 3 seconds

### 4.2 Resource Usage
- Bundle size: < 250KB (compressed)
- Memory usage: < 100MB in normal operation
- CPU usage: < 15% during normal operation
- Battery impact: Minimal for mobile devices

### 4.3 Optimization
- Assets must be properly compressed
- Images must be optimized and properly sized
- Caching strategies must be implemented
- Resource lazy loading where appropriate

## 5. Enforcement

### 5.1 Code Review
- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Automated checks must pass before merge
- Performance impact must be considered
- Security implications must be evaluated

### 5.2 Monitoring
- Performance metrics must be tracked
- User experience metrics must be monitored
- Error rates must be tracked
- Resource usage must be monitored

### 5.3 Regular Audits
- Monthly code quality reviews
- Quarterly performance audits
- Regular security assessments
- Periodic accessibility checks

This constitution serves as router living document and should be updated as our standards evolve. All team members are expected to adhere to these principles and contribute to their improvement.
